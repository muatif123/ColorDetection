# ColorDetection
A color detection algorithm identifies pixels in an image that match a specified color or color range. The color of detected pixels can then be changed to distinguish them from the rest of the image.

The algorithm is trained with the differnet colors data using a csv file with which it can identify many differnet types of colors available in the image.
